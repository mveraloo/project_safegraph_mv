# SafeGraph Semester Project

1. Please read the [Statement of Need](needs_statement.md) that your team will need to leverage to write your work proposal.
2. Use the [team_repo template](https://github.com/BYUI451/team_repo) for your writeup and submission.
    - Please make sure your team repo is private.
    - You will need to share your repo with me `hathawayj` and the current semester team.
3. Use this template repo to start your private repo within our organization. This repo will allow you to practice and share your personal work.
4. Review the scripts in this repo and make sure you can handle the SafeGraph data. Within two weeks we will have a coding challenge using SafeGraph data.
